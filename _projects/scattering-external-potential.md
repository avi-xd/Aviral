## Project Overview

This course project in Many-Body Physics (P460) explores  the problem of : **how do electrons behave when random impurities are introduced into a metal?** The project investigates the transition from free electron behavior to localized states through the lens of advanced theoretical frameworks including Green's functions and Feynman diagrams.

## Summary 

What happens when you introduce random impurities in a metal? How do electrons behave or move in the system? How does their behavior change compared to the free electron state? In this project, we studied this problem of "Random Impurities in Disordered Metals". We initially approached this problem using the equation of motion for Green's functions in momentum space, inspired by the solution to the famous Anderson impurity problem, which involves a single impurity outside a bath. However, for our system, momentum is not a good quantum number because the randomly placed impurities breaks the translational symmetry of the system, making momentum non-conserved and hence not an invariant quantity. Consequently, this approach led to a recursive solution, beyond which further progress was not possible. To address this limitation, we introduced the Matsubara Green's functions.

Matsubara Green's functions, also known as imaginary Green's functions, are defined in imaginary time. This transition from real time to imaginary time allows the expansion of the density matrix in the interaction picture, which involves calculations by transforming oscillatory terms into exponentially decaying ones, helps in exploration of the thermodynamic quantities. We introduced the Matsubara Green's functions, their mathematical structure, and key properties. To make the system momentum invariant, we defined the impurity self-average and proceeded to establish the Feynman rules and diagrams. These diagrammatic methods simplify solving such problems by providing a structured framework for visualizing and computing interactions. They allow the systematic identification and summation of specific classes of diagrams, such as crossing diagrams, which are crucial for understanding phenomena like weak localization and electron scattering.

We discussed the concept of self-energy and the reducibility of Feynman diagrams, along with different Born approximations, which involve selecting specific interaction pathways within the system. Additionally, we briefly explored how choosing particular diagrams can lead to weak localization of electrons. This phenomenon is demonstrated through interference effects in the electron's wave function due to scattering from impurities, resulting in a reduced probability of diffusion, highlighting the transition from metallic to insulating behavior as disorder increases.
