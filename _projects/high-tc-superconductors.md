## Project Overview

This summer internship at IISER Thiruvananthapuram provided hands-on experience with high-temperature superconductors, specifically focusing on the growth and characterization of cuprate superconductors.


## Summary
 Started the internship with learning about the High-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors and what makes them different from conventional superconductors. Worked on YBCO-123 (Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide) and BSCCO-2212 single crystals (a class of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors called as cuprate superconductors) and studied about their structure and properties. Learned about different techniques that are used in growing a crystal like Self-Flux method and Floating zone method and used them to grow the single crystal of YBCO and BSCCO superconductor.

Also learned about the experimental techniques like EDAX, powder and single crystal XRD, TEM, SEM and Raman spectroscopy. Worked on retieveld refinement analysis of the BSCCO PXRD data using the FULLPROF software. The primary purpose of Rietveld refinement is to determine the crystal structure and accurately quantify the atomic positions, lattice parameters, and other structural parameters of crystalline material. Rietveld refinement is invaluable in phase identification and quantification in complex mixtures or multiphase materials and in determining the miller indices. It can distinguish between different phases present in a sample and determine their relative proportions. I also had worked on setting and callibrating a high pressure chamber than can be used to produce the highly oxygen doped cuprate superconductors.
