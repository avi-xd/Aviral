Hi, I am Aviral Verma. I am pursuing an Integrated Master's degree in Physical Sciences from National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneshwar, India. I am currently in my 4th Year (8th Sem) of degree. 

# Research Interest

I am currently exploring my research interests, with a primary focus on the dynamics and emergent phenomena of quantum many-body systems. I am fascinated by how collective behaviors arise from the interactions of individual particles, leading to unexpected properties that cannot be understood by examining the components in isolation. I am interested in learning about the different analytical and numerical techniques used to study the behvaiour of such systems. Alongside this, I am also interested in quantum computation and information, especially their intersection with many-body physics.

While my recent focus has shifted toward theoretical models and dynamical systems, I do have a strong interest in the experimental side of condensed matter physics. The techniques used to characterize materials and uncover their properties remain fascinating to me, and I see immense value in connecting experimental insights with theoretical developments.

At this stage, I am eager to deepen my understanding of many-body systems and contribute to research in either theoretical or experimental domains that align with these interests.
